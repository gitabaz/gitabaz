      <description>Research Random Unitary Circuits: Measurement-driven phase transition I am interested in understanding the effect of projective measurements on the dynamics of entanglement in random quantum circuits. Recently, there have been many works, both numerical an analytical, demonstrating a dynamical quantum phase transition in the entanglement entropy driven by the competition of scrambling unitary dynamics and disentangling projective measurements. Below a critical value of the measurement rate $(p &amp;lt; p_c)$ the entanglement entropy scales with the volume of the subsystem while above $(p &amp;gt; p_c)$ the entanglement entropy scales with the area.</description>

      <title>Random Matrix Theory - Basics</title>

      <description>Introduction The first time I heard the term Random Matrix Theory (RMT) was at the Wednesday physics colloquium given by one of the faculty members at Rutgers. Immediately, I was intrigued by the idea of bringing together two of the most useful concepts in math: statistics and linear algebra. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious to me what we could learn from studying random matrices but the more research I did into the field, the more I realized that their usage was spreading across the different branches of science.</description>

      <title>A New Site Using Hugo</title>

      <description>I have just finished setting up a basic site using Hugo, a static site generator written in Go. Being a static site generator, Hugo builds pages when you create content instead of dynamically, when a vistor requests a page. This leads to fast and secure pages that can be hosted anywhere. I stumbled upon Hugo while browsing a random users github pages (I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the name) and the concept seemed ideal for my purposes: A website easy to setup, use, and manage.</description>
