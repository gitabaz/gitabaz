            Introduction The first time I heard the term Random Matrix Theory (RMT) was at the Wednesday physics colloquium given by one of the faculty members at Rutgers. Immediately, I was intrigued by the idea of bringing together two of the most useful concepts in math: statistics and linear algebra. It wasn&rsquo;t obvious to me what we could learn from studying random matrices but the more research I did into the field, the more I realized that their usage was spreading across the different branches of science.
