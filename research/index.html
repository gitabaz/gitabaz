<hr />

<p>I am interested in the application of novel analytical and numerical techniques to study the physics of strongly correlated electrons in condensed matter systems.</p>

<p>I am currently working on the projects described below.</p>

<h2 id="random-unitary-circuits">Random Unitary Circuits:</h2>

<h3 id="measurement-transition">Measurement transition</h3>

<p>Our current research lies at the intersection of quantum computation and fundamental many-body physics. The connection between the two is made through the use of the random quantum circuit model. Such a circuit is the quantum analogue for the operation of a classical computer: a collection of quantum bits is prepared in an initial state and evolves over time through the application of quantum logic gates. When the initial states and logic gates are appropriately chosen, the model corresponds to a quantum algorithm. As the logic gates are applied, the entanglement between the qubits begins to grow and the success of the computation relies on how well the entanglement structure is preserved prior to measuring the result. On the other hand, when the initial states and logic gates are chosen at random, the model has little to no structure and one of the few quantities that can describe the system is the dynamics of the entanglement among the qubits. By averaging over multiple random realizations of the circuit, we can learn a great deal about how entanglement spreads in generic quantum mechanical systems, a key element in understanding how these systems reach equilibrium.</p>

<p>In our work, we study the random quantum circuit with local projective measurements. This model is a variation of the random circuit model through which entanglement growth can not only be reduced but also completely destroyed. As stated previously, this has severe implications in both quantum computation and quantum many-body physics where the behavior of entanglement plays a crucial role. Our goal is to understand how this transition behaves as the frequency of measurements is increased and how robust the transition is to changes in the structure of the circuit.</p>

<h2 id="bcs-dynamics">BCS Dynamics:</h2>

<h3 id="quantum-quench-in-a-p-wave-superfluid">Quantum quench in a $p$-wave superfluid</h3>

<p>The search for a robust platform capable of quantum simulation and computation has led to a growing interest in superfluids with $p + ip$ pairing symmetry. These superfluids are expected to possess zero-energy Majorana bound states which could exhibit the non-abelian statistics necessary for a topological quantum computer. We are interested in studying the non-equilibrium quench dynamics of the two dimensional BCS Hamiltonian with $p$-wave symmetry using numerical techniques. It is known how a system which begins in a $p + ip$ state of the $p$-wave Hamiltonian evolves due to its integrability, but we would like to investigate the stability of the dynamics when this integrability is broken. These dynamics can potentially be realized in ultracold gases and could provide experimental verification to the predicted behavior.</p>

<h2 id="heavy-fermion-quantum-criticality">Heavy Fermion Quantum Criticality:</h2>

<h3 id="kondo-lattice">Kondo lattice</h3>

<p>Quantum criticality plays a central role in strongly correlated systems and can be easily studied in heavy fermion systems due to the small energy scales involved in their description. The microscopic theory of heavy fermions can be described through a competition between the RKKY interaction and the Kondo coupling. The original Doniach phase diagram separated an ordered magnetic phase from a Fermi liquid phase based on the relative strength of the two interactions, however, it has recently been shown that a new parameter, describing frustration, must be introduced in order to describe the full phase diagram. In our work we study the effects of magnetic frustration on the phase diagram of heavy fermions.</p>
