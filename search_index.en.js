Being a static site generator, Hugo builds pages when you create content instead of dynamically, when a vistor requests a page. This leads to fast and secure pages that can be hosted anywhere.\nI stumbled upon Hugo while browsing a random users github pages (I can't remember the name) and the concept seemed ideal for my purposes: A website easy to setup, use, and manage. Hugo advertises to do this and much more, offering many features and possibilities for customization. I am very new to the Hugo universe so all of its features remain to be seen but so far I have been impressed with the ease of setup which I detail below.\nSetting up my first site\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nTo setup Hugo, I basically followed the Install Hugo and Quick Start guides found here.\nI am currently running Ubuntu 19.04 so to install Hugo I simply download the .deb file from the Hugo github and got the latest version (currently v0.58.3). Once that was done I made a directory where I would store my Hugo websites and initiated a Hugo site.\n{{&lt; highlight bash \"linenos=table,style=monokai\" &gt;}}\nmkdir ~/sites\nhugo new site \n{{&lt; /highlight &gt;}}\nThe next step on the guide was to install a theme. I chose to go with the basic Ananke. In order to install, I initiated a git repository in my ~/sites/&lt;SITENAME&gt; directory and added the theme as a submodule in the themes/ananke directory. The submodule is a great way to include a third party project into your own project. Once the theme has been downloaded, tell hugo to use the theme by adding it to the config.toml file.\n\nThe next step is to add some content. This is easily done by running\n{{&lt; highlight bash \"linenos=inline,style=monokai,linenostart=7\" &gt;}}\n\nOnce the post is created, it'll have some default content that includes the post title, date created, and marks it as a draft. This can easily be edited using any text editor to include the content you like.\nThe last thing to do before testing is to open up config.toml and edit the site name and url.\n\nThe site can now be viewed on a local Hugo server before publishing.\n\nThe -D in the command indicates that drafts should be published. The site can be viewed at http://localhost:1313/.\nThat's it! The Hugo site is basically complete. To push it to a live server, make sure any post that should be published is not marked as a draft and then run\n\nto build the static pages. When it's complete, the ouput to be uploaded to the live server will be in the public folder.\nWhile trying to customize my own site, I found the Hugo docs to be a bit confusing. Browsing other sources on the web, I came across a blog which was extremely helpful. The blog goes over most of the basics and is a quick way to familiarize yourself with the Hugo ecosystem.\n","id":"https://gitabaz.github.io/blog/a-new-site-using-hugo/","title":"A new site using Hugo"},"https://gitabaz.github.io/blog/combinatorics-through-complex-analysis/":{"body":"In a recent project I came across the following problem: Evaluate\n\\begin{equation}\na_{N,z} = \\sum_{\\{\\alpha\\} \\in \\mathcal{A}_{N,z}} \\prod_{\\alpha} e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta\\alpha}{N}}\n\\label{eq:exact_az}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{A}_{N,z}$ contains all sets with $z$ unique integers chosen\nfrom $\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ and $\\{\\alpha\\}$ labels a particular set. To clarify\nwhat this means, consider the case where $N = 4$ and $z=2$. The sum we are\ninterested in runs over the terms\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{A}_{N=4,z=2} =\n\\{\n\\{1,2\\},\n\\{1,3\\},\n\\{1,4\\},\n\\{2,3\\},\n\\{2,4\\},\n\\{3,4\\}\n\\}\n\\end{equation}\nso that\n\\begin{equation}\na_{N=4,z=2} =\ne^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta(1 + 2)}{N}} +\ne^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta(1 + 3)}{N}} +\ne^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta(1 + 4)}{N}} +\ne^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta(2 + 3)}{N}} +\ne^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta(2 + 4)}{N}} +\ne^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta(3 + 4)}{N}}.\n\\end{equation}\nFor arbitrary $N$ and $z$ there are $\\binom{N}{z}$ of these terms so that when\n$N$ gets large and $z$ is $O(N)$ carrying out the sum directly becomes\nunfeasible. However, there is a nice trick we can use that connects\ncombinatorics with complex analysis and allows us to evaluate the result in the\nlarge $N$ limit.\nHelper function\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nThe first step is to introduce the helper function\n\\begin{equation}\n\\prod_{j=1}^N \\left(1 + te^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta j}{N}} \\right) = \\sum_{r=0}^N a_{N,r} t^r\n\\label{eq:helper_func}\n\\end{equation}\nand notice that it is a polynomial in $t$ whose coefficients $a_{N,r}$ are\nexactly the sums we are trying to evaluate. To see this, consider again the\ncase where $N=4$. Expanding the left hand side of Eq. $\\eqref{eq:helper_func}$\n\\begin{align}\n1 + \\notag \\\\\nt   \\left( e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta 1}{N}} + e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta 2}{N}} + e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta 3}{N}} + e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta 4}{N}} \\right) + \\notag \\\\\nt^2 \\left( e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta (1+2)}{N}} + e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta (1+3)}{N}} + e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta (1+4)}{N}} + e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta (2+3)}{N}} + e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta (2+4)}{N}} + e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta (3+4)}{N}} \\right) + \\\\\nt^3 \\left( e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta (1+2+3)}{N}} + e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta (1+2+4)}{N}} + e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta (1+3+4)}{N}} + e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta (2+3+4)}{N}} \\right) + \\notag \\\\\nt^4 \\left( e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)}{N}}\\right) \\notag\n\\end{align}\nwe see that the coefficient of the $t^2$ term is exactly $a_{N=4, z=2}$. In\norder to pick out the term that we are interested in ($r=z$) we rewrite the\nparameter $t$ as $t=e^{-i\\phi}$ and multiply by\n$(2\\pi)^{-1}\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\mathrm{d}\\phi e^{i\\phi z}$.\nApplying the transformation to the right hand side of Eq. $\\eqref{eq:helper_func}$\nfirst we see that we get exactly what we wanted\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sum_{r=0}^N a_{N,r} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\mathrm{d}\\phi e^{-i\\phi (r-z)} =\n\\sum_{r=0}^N a_{N,r}\\delta_{r,z} = a_{N,z},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere we have interchanged the order of the sum and integral and used the\ndefinition of the delta function\nin terms of its Fourier transform. Therefore, we have\n\\begin{equation}\na_{N,z} =\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\mathrm{d}\\phi\n\\left[\ne^{i\\phi z}\n\\prod_{j=1}^N \\left(1 + e^{-i\\phi}e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta j}{N}} \\right)\n\\right].\n\\end{equation}\nThe large $N$ limit\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nTo evaluate the integral in the large $N$ limit, we use the\nsaddle-point method.\nIt is convenient to rewrite the above equation as\n\\begin{equation}\na_{N,z} =\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\mathrm{d}\\phi e^{z f(\\phi)};\n\\quad\nf(\\phi) = i\\phi + \\frac{1}{z}\\sum_{j=1}^N \\ln \\left[1 + e^{-i\\phi}e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta j}{N}}\\right],\n\\end{equation}\nand take $z, N \\to \\infty$ with $z/N = \\mathrm{const}$.\nAn important step is to find the stationary point $\\phi_0$, where\n$f'(\\phi_0) = 0$, and the second derivative $f''(\\phi_0)$.\nBy turning the sum over $j$ to an integral over $x = j/N$ we find\n\\begin{equation}\n\\phi_0 = -i \\ln\n\\left[\n\\frac{e^{-\\frac{2\\pi\\eta(N-z)}{N}} - 1}{1 - e^{\\frac{2\\pi\\eta z}{N}}}\n\\right]\n\\quad \\mathrm{and} \\quad\nf''(\\phi_0) = -\\frac{N\\sinh\\left[\\pi\\eta\\right]}{4\\pi\\eta z}\\sec\\left[\\frac{\\phi_0}{2}\\right]\\mathrm{sech}\\left[\\pi\\eta + \\frac{\\phi_0}{2}\\right],\n\\end{equation}\nup to $O(1/N)$ corrections. These results can then be substitute into the\nsaddle point equation\n\\begin{equation}\na_{N,z} = \\frac{e^{zf(\\phi_0)}}{\\sqrt{-2\\pi z f''(\\phi_0)}}.\n\\end{equation}\nNote that it is important to keep sub-leading\ncorrections to the integral when evaluating $f(\\phi_0)$ since it introduces an\noverall prefactor to the result.\nFinal result\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nThe final result is then\n\\begin{equation}\na_{N,z} =\ne^{-i\\phi_0(N-z) - \\pi\\eta N}\n\\left(\n\\frac{1 + e^{-i\\phi_0 - 2\\pi\\eta}}{1 + e^{-i\\phi_0}}\n\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\ne^{\\frac{N}{2\\pi\\eta}\\left(\n\\mathrm{Li}_2\\left[-e^{i\\phi_0}\\right] - \\mathrm{Li}_2\\left[-e^{i\\phi_0 + 2\\pi\\eta}\\right]\n\\right)}\n\\left[\n\\frac{N\\sinh\\left[\\pi\\eta\\right]}{2\\eta}\\sec\\left[\\frac{\\phi_0}{2}\\right]\\mathrm{sech}\\left[\\pi\\eta + \\frac{\\phi_0}{2}\\right]\n\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\n\\label{eq:approx_az}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathrm{Li}_2(z)$ is the polylogarithm.\nBelow we plot the exact expression (Eq. $\\eqref{eq:exact_az}$) and the\napproximation (Eq. $\\eqref{eq:approx_az}$) for $N=20$ and $\\eta = 0.1$. We see\nthat there is excellent agreement between the results.\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n","id":"https://gitabaz.github.io/blog/combinatorics-through-complex-analysis/","title":"Combinatorics through complex analysis"},"https://gitabaz.github.io/blog/rmt-basics/":{"body":"Introduction\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nThe first time I heard the term Random Matrix Theory (RMT) was at the\nWednesday physics colloquium\ngiven by one of the faculty members at Rutgers. Immediately, I was intrigued by\nthe idea of bringing together two of the most useful concepts in math:\nstatistics and linear algebra. It wasn't obvious to me what we could learn from\nstudying random matrices but the more research I did into the field, the more I\nrealized that their usage was spreading across the different branches of\nscience.\nIn an effort to learn the basics, I read through multiple sets of lecture notes\nand articles looking for examples that would build on my background and\nfamiliarity with physics. The simplest (and most helpful) example that I found\nthat illustrated the concepts of RMT was the exact result for the 2x2 Gaussian\nOrthogonal Ensemble (GOE) level repulsion. Before we get into the details and\nsignificance of GOE, level repulsion, and other concepts let's take a look at\nthe example.\nThe 2x2 Example\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nRandom Variables\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nIf you're familiar with statistics, you'll understand the concept of random\nvariables. To summarize, a\nrandom variable $X$ is one whose value is sampled from a distribution. The\nclassic examples of discrete random variables are the result of a coin toss or\ndice roll. Examples of continuous random variables are those that sample from a\nGaussian or uniform distribution.\nIn any case, a normally\ndistributed random variable\nis often written as $X\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$ meaning that the values of\n$X$ are sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard\ndeviation $\\sigma$. In other words the probability density function\n(pdf) of $X$,\n$f_X(x)$, is given by\n\\begin{equation}\nf_X(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp \\left[-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right]\n\\end{equation}\nso that the probability that the value of $X$ lies between $a$ and $b$ is given by\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Pr[a \\leq X \\leq b] = \\int_a^b dx f_X(x).\n\\end{equation}\nRandom Matrices\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nWith the concept of random variables, we can now introduce a random matrix. A\nrandom matrix is simply a matrix whose entries are random variables. The\nGaussian Orthogonal Ensemble mentioned before is an ensemble of real symmetric\nrandom matrices whose entries are normally distributed random variables.\nConsider the GOE containing matrices of the form\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{bmatrix}X_1 &amp; X_3 \\\\X_3 &amp; X_2\\end{bmatrix}\n\\label{eq:goe}\n\\end{equation}\nwith $X_1\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, $X_2\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, and\n$X_3\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\frac{1}{2})$.\nSampling from this ensemble will give matrices that look like\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{bmatrix}0.554030 &amp; -0.471710 \\\\ -0.471710 &amp; -0.124200\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation}\nSeparation Between Eigenvalues\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nWhat can we learn from generating matrices from the ensemble described by Eq.\n$\\eqref{eq:goe}$? The answer is usually in the spectral properties, i.e. the\nproperties of the eigenvalues. One question we might like to answer is: what\nis the typical spacing between eigenvalues?\nTo approach this problem we need to diagonalize a random matrix. Although this\nmay seem strange it is actually straight forward. Take Eq. \\eqref{eq:goe} and\ndo the usual diagonalization procedure i.e. set\n\\begin{equation}\n\\det \\begin{bmatrix}(X_1 - \\lambda ) &amp; X_3 \\\\X_3 &amp; (X_2 -\\lambda ) \\end{bmatrix} = 0\n\\end{equation}\nand solve for $\\lambda$.\nFor a 2x2 matrix this can be easily solved to give\n\\begin{equation}\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 \\pm \\sqrt{(X_1-X_2)^2 + 4 X_3^2}}{2}\n\\label{eq:ev}.\n\\end{equation}\nThe spacing, $s$, is then given by\n\\begin{equation}\ns = \\lambda_+ - \\lambda_- = \\sqrt{(X_1-X_2)^2 + 4 X_3^2}\n\\label{eq:spa}.\n\\end{equation}\nSince $s$ is a function of random variables, it itself is a random variable and we can find its pdf, i.e. the probability distribution of the spacing between the eigenvalues. This is given by:\n\\begin{equation}\np(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dx_1 dx_2 dx_3 \\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x_1^2}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\frac{e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x_2^2}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\frac{e^{-x_3^2}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\delta(s-\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + 4 x_3^2})\n\\label{eq:psfull}\n\\end{equation}\nTo proceed it is helpful to introduce new variables $r,\\theta,\\psi$ defined\nthrough\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{cases}\nx_1 - x_2 = r\\cos(\\theta) \\\\\n2x_3 = r\\sin(\\theta) \\\\\nx_1 + x_2 = \\psi\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\nUpon substitution into Eq. $\\eqref{eq:psfull}$ we obtain\n\\begin{equation}\np(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dr ~r\\delta(s-r) \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\psi ~e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(\\frac{r\\cos(\\theta)+\\psi}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{-r\\cos(\\theta)+\\psi}{2}\\right)^2+\\frac{r^2\\sin^2(\\theta)}{2}\\right]}\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\np(s) = \\frac{s}{2}e^{-s^2 /4}\n\\end{equation}\nWe can rescale our result by the mean level spacing, $\\langle s \\rangle =\n\\sqrt{\\pi}$ and the final result is known as Wigner's Surmise:\n\\begin{equation}\np(s) = \\frac{\\pi s}{2}e^{-\\frac{1}{4}\\pi s^2}\n\\label{eq:wigsur}\n\\end{equation}\nFrom Eq. $\\eqref{eq:wigsur}$ we see that the probability that two eigenvalues\nare either very close together or very far apart vanishes. This behavior is\nknown as level repulsion and is a generic feature of correlated random\nvariables. If we were to look at the probability distribution of the seperation\nbetween uncorrelated random variables, we would see something drastically\ndifferent. In fact, we find that the separation is given by $p(s) = e^{-s}$ and\nwe see that the random variables do not repel but rather attract.\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n\nSummary\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nThe idea that we can learn anything by studying random matrices may be quite\nsurprising. At first glance it seems that there is not much to gain by studying\na matrix made up of independent random variables. However, by studying the\nspectral properites of these matrices we find that there are correlations in\nthe spectrum as a result of trading the description of an $N\\times N$ matrix of\nrandom variables to a description using its $N$ eigenvalues. We have seen level\nrepulsion as one example of many generic features that arise in correlated\nsystems. In physics, the most interesting problems arise when the correlations\nbetween the particles are strong and often times random matrix theory finds its\nway into the description.\nThe example above is based on the notes by Livan, Novaes, and\nVivo\n","id":"https://gitabaz.github.io/blog/rmt-basics/","title":"Random matrix theory - Basics"},"https://gitabaz.github.io/blog/site-refresh-hugo-to-zola/":{"body":"It has been a while since I have updated this site. A big reason for this is\nthat I built a new computer and did not have the required Hugo files to\ncontinue updating the site. I only ever pushed the public folder to github\nand not the actual Hugo site development files. At some point, I copied over\nthe minimum required files (the posts, css, etc.) so that I could one day\nrebuild everything. That day is today! A lot has changed since I last used Hugo\nbut it is just as confusing as I remember (now with even more added confusion?\nwhat are/when to use modules?). In any case, we are going to rebuild the site\nfrom the ground up and copy over files as necessary to maintain the same look\nof the original version.\nI started this post to document the setup of the website but along the way I\nran into a number of issues which made the refresh a pain. Some of the pain\npoints include:\n\nContent pages are now created with frontmatter in toml instead of yaml.\nTrying to build a \"hello world\" of sorts with no added themes just fails due\nto missing files.\nInstalling a theme is inconsistent: documentation says to use git submodules\nbut many themes are now using Hugo modules.\nAfter finding a theme I liked, I had to go through multiple hoops such as\nupgrading to a newer extended version of Hugo, update some write permissions\nto .cache, having to install and updated version of npm and nodejs, and npm\ninstalling a ton of packages (see image below).\nEven then, I couldn't get the theme to work properly as the json resume\nfeature was failing for some reason.\nIn order to get math equations to render the theme comes with some basic\ninstructions to setup katex. Unfortunately, katex is missing features such as\nequation labels which I tend to use a lot. It also did not properly display\ninline equations and was rendering them twice.\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\nI always seem to have difficulties when working with Hugo. I tried reading\nthrough the documentation but it is so scattered that I end up having 3-4 tabs\nper topic I am trying to understand. I ended up deciding to switch to a\ndifferent static site generator, preferably one that was simpler and not\nnode/js based. After reading a few blog posts, I noticed other people have had\nthe same difficulty working with Hugo\n[1,\n2,\n3] and switched to\nZola. Zola is supposed to be much simpler to use and my experience was just\nthat.\nSetting up Zola\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nThe documentation has a nick quickstart tutorial that shows up to get up and\nrunning and build some templates. After following the initial set up steps\n\nthe resulting directory structure is\n\nI tried to immediately view the site with\n\nand visiting localhost:1111; and to my surprise it just worked! I saw a\n\"Welcome to Zola!\" page with a message indicating there was no template to\nrender so it was showing a default page and some recommendations for how to\nproceed. Already off to a much better start than with Hugo.\nI continued following the basic getting started\ntutorial to\nget a feel for how Zola works. Overall, it seems intuitive and\nstraight-forward. I like how all of the configuration options are listed on a\nsingle\npage.\nThe same is true for other settings such as the frontmatter\noptions of a page.\nCustomization\n    \n        \n        \n    \n\n\nWith the basics out of the way, I went straight into downloading a theme for\nthe site. The recommended way is to just do a git clone in the themes folder\nbut I opted to add the theme as a submodule similar to what I did before when\nusing Hugo. This is because my site directory is a git repository itself.\n\nIn order to get mathjax rendering I simply added the fields in config.toml\n\nand then placed the code below into my copy of templates/base.html\n\nThis makes it so that I can enable/disable including the mathjax js file by\nswitching a flag in config.toml. Since the include happens in the base.html\nfile it means that all site pages will have the import. It will probably be\nbetter to move this flag into the page frontmatter so that we don't import it\nwhen it's not used but this also lets us use latex everywhere which is nice.\nThe order of the scripts seems to be important as I was having difficulty\nrendering inline math on chrome with the reversed order.\nOverall the setup was simple but I did run into some issues. Two things I\nstruggled with were: getting the site to compile due a missing banner.jpg\nfile and getting syntax highlighting to use the colorschemes I wanted. For the\nimage issue, the image was in the theme's static folder\nthemes/&lt;themename&gt;/static so I thought it would be found by Zola. I spent a\nlot of time trying to figure out why it couldn't find it and I'm still not 100%\nsure, but I believe it is because the image was being modified through a\nshortcode and so it needs to be at the point of origin. For the colorscheme\nissue, I am unable to change the colorscheme using a css file and the visitor's\nlight/dark mode preferences. It always defaults to material-light/material-dark\neven though I set it as gruvbox-light/gruvbox-dark. Other than those issues,\neverything else was smooth sailing and a lot of my confusion was cleared up by\nreading the documentation.\nThe templating engine used, Tera is simple\nenough that I was able to edit the theme defaults and include some additional\nfeatures.
