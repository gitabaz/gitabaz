            Introduction The first time I heard the term Random Matrix Theory (RMT) was at the Wednesday physics colloquium given by one of the faculty members at Rutgers. Immediately, I was intrigued by the idea of bringing together two of the most useful concepts in math: statistics and linear algebra. It wasn&rsquo;t obvious to me what we could learn from studying random matrices but the more research I did into the field, the more I realized that their usage was spreading across the different branches of science.

            I have just finished setting up a basic site using Hugo, a static site generator written in Go. Being a static site generator, Hugo builds pages when you create content instead of dynamically, when a vistor requests a page. This leads to fast and secure pages that can be hosted anywhere. I stumbled upon Hugo while browsing a random users github pages (I can&rsquo;t remember the name) and the concept seemed ideal for my purposes: A website easy to setup, use, and manage.
